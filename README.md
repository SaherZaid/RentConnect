RentConnect is a peer-to-peer rental platform that enables users to rent items they own or borrow items from other users.  
Instead of buying expensive tools or equipment for one-time use, RentConnect makes sharing easier, more affordable, and more sustainable.

---

## 🎯 Purpose & Concept

The main idea behind RentConnect is to build a system that solves a real need. Many people own items they rarely use, while others need the same items occasionally.

RentConnect connects those users through a platform where they can:

- List items they want to rent out  
- Search for available items nearby  
- Request bookings and manage availability  
- Communicate with the owner  
- Track rental status and confirmations  

This creates a community sharing ecosystem that encourages sustainability and reduces waste, while also giving owners a chance to earn money from unused items.

✔ Real-time chat between renters and item owners  
✔ Booking calendar with blocked and reserved dates  
✔ Email notifications and request confirmations

## 💡 Development Journey

This project was built entirely from scratch from idea, planning, and architecture to implementation and UI logic.  
The goal wasn't just to create a prototype, but to build a complete working system with real-world potential.

Throughout development, I explored different architectural patterns, experimented with real-time communication, and solved complex UI interactions such as date availability logic and booking conflicts.
